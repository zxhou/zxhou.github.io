I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Guangdong Institute of Intelligence Science and Technology(GDIIST)](https://gdiist.cn/). Before this, I obtained a PhD, a Master's degree in Computer Science, and a Bachelor's degree in Optical Information Technology from [Nanjing University of Science and Technology(NJUST)](https://www.njust.edu.cn/). During my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to visit the [Zhuhai UM Science&Technology Research Institute (ZUMRI)](http://zumri.cn/) and [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) from Sep. 2021 to Dec. 2022. I also worked as an intern at the Chip Algorithm Department of [HOUMO.AI](https://www.houmoai.com/) from Apr. to Oct. 2023.

My research interests include **Brain-inspired Computing**, **Robotic Manipulation**, and **3D Vision**.
