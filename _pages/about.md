I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Nanjing University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Yan Yan](https://tomyan555.github.io/). Before this, I received my master's degree in Computer Science advised by Prof. [Hui Kong](https://sites.google.com/view/huikonglab/members/hui-kong) and bachelorâ€™s degree in Optical Information and Technology at Nanjing University of Science and Technology. During my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to visit the [Zhuhai UM Science&Technology Research Institute (ZUMRI)](http://zumri.cn/) and [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) from Sep. 2021 to Dec. 2022. I also worked as an intern at the Chip Algorithm Department of [HOUMO.AI](https://www.houmoai.com/) from Apr. to Oct. 2023.

My research interests include **Point Cloud Processing**, **Place Recognition**, and **Efficient 3D**.
